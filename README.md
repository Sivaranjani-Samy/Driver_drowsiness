# Driver_drowsiness
Drowsiness is one of the underlying causes of car accidents, which contribute to a large number of fatalities on the road each year. Although numerous methods for detecting drowsiness have been developed, image processing techniques are faster and more accurate than the other methods.The goal of this project was to detect levels of drowsiness in a driving simulator using image processing techniques. Detecting levels of drowsiness in drivers is critical to reducing the number of fatalities in traffic accidents. It is critical to develop such systems that accurately determine the levels of drowsiness in drivers in order to reduce the number of car accidents. More importantly, image processing-based methods for detecting driver drowsiness are fast and precise. Fatigue and drowsiness cause some visible signs on the driver's face. The principles of image processing-based methods are based on the interpretation of such signals. In many cases, recognising the facial zone from received images is the first step in image processing. Then, drowsiness-related parameters such as eyes are identified and their changes are investigated to detect sleepiness levels.
